SCATE INSTALLATION

The following should build Scate and install it into KDE locations relative to "/usr/local":

  cmake .
  make
  make install

You should then add "/usr/local" to your KDEDIRS environment variable.

Alternatively, you can execute:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path

instead of "cmake ." to change install location (for example to where KDE is installed -
- in that case you do not need to change KDEDIRS).

In order for KDE to discover newly installed Kate plugin you should then execute:

  kbuildsycoca4

or restart KDE. Next time you run Kate, Scate will appear under Plugins section of Kate's
configuration window where you can turn the plugin on.
