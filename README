SCATE CONFIGURATION AND USAGE

After you enable the Scate plugin in Kate's configuration window, you will be able to access
the Scate configuration page in the same window.

By default, the SuperCollider intepreter is not started when Scate is. You can change this on
Scate configuration page.

There you can also set the SuperCollider runtime data path and the full path with filename
of SwingOSC GUI server java program.

Enabling the Scate plugin will add the "SuperCollider" menu to Kate's main menu bar with options
to control the interpreter, sound server, SwingOSC server and more.

Scate will also add a tab to Kate's bottom tool area where the interpreter's output will be printed.

When the interpreter is running, you can execute code in two ways:

1. Below the interpreter output area there is a command line where you can simply type in
SuperCollider commands and execute them by pressing "Enter". You can access previously executed
commands with "Up" and "Down" keys.

2. You can let the interpreter evaluate SuperCollider code within a Kate document by selecting
it and invoking Ctrl+E shortcut or invoking respective action in SuperCollider menu.
