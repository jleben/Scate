able to access the Scate configuration page in the same window.

    command "sclang" will be executed.

- Help directory:
    The directory where SuperCollider help files reside.

SCATE USAGE
********************************************************************************

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER INTERFACE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enabling the Scate plugin will add the "SuperCollider" menu to Kate's main menu
bar with options to start or stop the interpreter, sound server, SwingOSC
server, and more.

Scate will add two tabs to Kate's bottom tool area:

- SC Output: opens the window where the interpreter's output will be printed and
  code can be executed.

- SC Help: opens the window where you can browse SC help files.

You can move these tabs to another tool area via the menu that pops up when
you right-click on them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE EXECUTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the interpreter is running, you can execute code in two ways:

1. Below the interpreter output area there is a command line where you can
simply type in SuperCollider commands and execute them by pressing "Enter". You
can access previously executed commands with "Up" and "Down" keys.

2. You can let the interpreter evaluate SuperCollider code within a Kate
document by selecting it and invoking Ctrl+E shortcut or invoking respective
action in SuperCollider menu. If no text is selected entire current line is
evaluated.
